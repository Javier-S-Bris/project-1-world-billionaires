# Introduction

The goal of this project is to gain knowledge about the richest persons in the world. To do this, I'll analyze a dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset).

The dataset contains statistics about the world's wealthiest people: where they live, what are their sources of income, how wealthy they are as well as some economic indicators of their countries.
