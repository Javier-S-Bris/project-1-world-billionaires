# Introduction

The goal of this project is to gain knowledge about the richest persons in the world. To do this, I'll analyze a dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset).

The dataset contains statistics about the world's wealthiest people: where they live, what are their sources of income, how wealthy they are as well as some economic indicators of their countries.

# Structure

This project contains two main notebooks:

- **v2_billions_eda** which is included in the main folder. It has the all the code related to Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (basic, advanced and dashboards)

- **billions_dashboard** included in the *dashboard_code* folder. It uses a .CSV file that contains the cleaned data resulted from data preprocessing in the previous section to generate two dashboards that look at the data using country and industry dimensions to provide additional insights and visual clues into the billionaires' wealth distribution accross the globe.
  The code for the dashboards is also included in the first notebook, this one is just to generate the dasboards right away without preprocessing the data.
